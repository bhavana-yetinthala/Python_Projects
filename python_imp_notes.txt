How to get pull requests information on a repository using python ?

- requests module, need to import this module
- API (url) -> pull, search github API documentations, will get REST API documentations, search for what ever you need, for eg: pull request
  
  a) need to just copy the url and take note of it 
  b) in the url, you will have organization name then repository name
  c) should give api.github.com before url, for eg: "api.github.com/repos/kubernetes/kubernetes/pulls"
  d) you can simply copy the above url in your personal laptop (in any browser), you will get the full information
  e) but need to do using python, code is below as follows:
     
     import requests
     response = requests.get("https://url")
     print(response.json())

  f) the above code python code prints the same output in the same way of giving url on any browser.
  g) for http status code, just give as print(response.status_code()) - to know if the request is successful or not. If not success, you will get an error 404.
