Task: To get pull request information on a Git repository using Python

Project taken: Open Source Project

Algorithm for implementing/ssteps for implementing this particular task:

Requirement: To get pull requests on a Github repository, we need to write a Python script.

There are two entities here:

1) On our local machine, we need to write a Python script to interact with the "GitHub" component.
2) To interact with a particular tool, there are two primary things. They are:
   You can interact with the API or
   You can interact with CLI; again, CLI sometimes uses APIs only internally.

Note: 
1) As a devops engineer, you talk to tools either through API's or CLI's (each one will have a particular cli, for example, AWS cli).
2) When you are writing a Python script by yourself, you use the API model.


Step1: 
You need to identify the module that is available in Python to talk to the GitHub API. Python has a very generic, popular module called the "requests module.".
You need to use this "requests module,"  install this module, and import this module.
Step2:
need to make an API call by using this "requests module."
I need to know what the "url" is to make the API call.

Imp Point:
Github will have multiple microservices, a pull request-related context, and an issue-related context. 
Basically, we need to know what the GitHub API is for pull requests.
We will get the GitHub API from the GitHub documentation.


Step3:
Information will be obtained in JSON format.
- You need to convert that information into dictionary format because Python cannot perform operations directly on JSON (that is, can only perform on the native data types that it has). 
(The dictionary is the closest one and easy, too.))

Step4:
Print all the pull request information.
 

Project:

Let's start with the identifying module.

How do I search for a pull request?

Search Google for github API documentation.
- click on it. On the left side, you will have the rest of the API references.
search for pull requests, list pull requests
After scrolling down, you will find the URL on the right side.
Copy and keep that URL.

Let's start with Python code.

1) First, install the "pip install requests" module in the terminal.
2) Import the requests module; import requests
3) Copy and paste the url that you have taken, and replace "owner" with the name of the place where you want to get pull requests. Basically, it will be the organization name, followed by the repository name.

For example, the url will be "api.github.com/repos/hashicorp/terraform/pulls."

But how can the URL be accessed?

Personal Browser:

   If doing it on a personal laptop, just copy the URL and paste it in your favorite browser.
You will get information about pull requests, where Terraform says, "These are the pull requests that are available."
You will have complete information about the user who has created this pull request.
For each and every user, there are properties. These properties are dictionaries.
That means what we get as an output is a list of dictionaries.

How to do using a Python program?

You have a syntax called requests. get(url)
Syntax is common, even if we do it 10 or 100 or 1000 times.
- Copying and pasting the URL into your favorite browser is equivalent to making a request. get("https://api.     ") in python 
Save the URL in a variable and print that response.
a) print (variable): you will get an object, and the output that we get will be an object.
b) print(type(variable)) - you will get type
c) print(variable.json())—you will get the same response that we have seen in the web browser.
d) print(variable.status_code): you will get output of 200, which is a https status code.

So, here response is an object that this module is returning, which has multiple functions where you get different types of outputs.
   If we do response.status_code, you can see if the API call is successful or not. If it is a failure, you might see a 404, 500, or 403 if there are authentication issues.
   To get the entire thing that you will see in the url, just do response.json
- 
  
How is the output converted to json from the dictionary?

   response.json(), this will automatically convert internally from json to dictionary.
Generally, when you are getting the JSON object directly, you have to do this conversion, but if you are using response.json, this is automatically taken care of.

How do you make it readable, as the output is very big?
   
Use cases:

1) How do I print the names of the people who have created the pull request? Let's see how to get the first person's ID, username, etc.

First, store the complete dictionary response into a variable, then
- print(variable[0]["id"]) prints the ID of the user
      
As shown in the above example, particular outputs can be obtained by traversing the information:
- print(variable[][][])

In order to get multiple values, you can use loops:

for i in range (len(variable)):
          print(variable[i]["user"]["login"])

 
In this way, Python will be used to interact with external sources like Github and Jira and can write as many complicated programs as possible.

Next, Advanced Tasks:

Along with user names, you want to print how many pull requests the user created.

Challenges faced:
1) Finding the right URL
2) typographical errors while coding


Chat GPT:

Sure, here's a more structured and technical breakdown of the steps, challenges, and additional points for the Python project to fetch pull requests information from a GitHub repository:

Steps:
Identify the Python Module:

Research and choose a suitable Python module for making HTTP requests to interact with the GitHub API. The requests module is commonly used for this purpose.
Obtain the GitHub API URL for Pull Requests:

Refer to the GitHub API documentation to find the specific endpoint for retrieving pull requests information.
Construct the URL by appending the owner (organization or user) and repository name to the base URL.
Make API Call:

Use the chosen Python module to send an HTTP GET request to the constructed GitHub API URL.
Handle Response:

Parse the JSON response received from the API call.
Convert the JSON data into a Python dictionary for easier manipulation.
Extract and Print Pull Requests Information:

Traverse the dictionary to extract relevant information about the pull requests, such as user names, pull request IDs, etc.
Print the extracted information in a readable format.
Challenges:
Finding the Correct API URL:

Identifying the correct endpoint in the GitHub API documentation for pull requests.
Ensuring the URL is constructed accurately to fetch the desired data.
Handling Authentication:

Dealing with authentication challenges if the GitHub API requires authentication (e.g., using personal access tokens).
Error Handling:

Implementing error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle HTTP status codes indicating errors (e.g., 404 for not found, 403 for authentication issues).
Data Parsing and Extraction:

Parsing the JSON response and extracting specific information from nested dictionaries.
Additional Points:
Data Processing and Analysis:

Beyond printing pull request information, you can perform further analysis on the data, such as counting the number of pull requests per user, calculating average pull request size, etc.
Pagination Handling:

GitHub API often paginates responses for endpoints that return a large number of items. Implement logic to handle pagination and fetch all relevant data.
Rate Limiting and Throttling:

GitHub API imposes rate limits to prevent abuse. Ensure your script adheres to these limits by implementing appropriate rate-limiting strategies.
Modularization and Reusability:

Design your script in a modular and reusable manner, allowing easy integration into larger projects or usage by other developers.
Documentation and Comments:

Document your code thoroughly, including comments explaining the purpose of each function and section. This enhances code readability and maintainability.
By addressing these steps, challenges, and additional points, you can develop a robust Python script for fetching pull requests information from a GitHub repository efficiently and reliably.

Important Modules:

How does python talk to external sources ?
ChatGPT
Python can communicate with external sources such as web servers, databases, APIs, and other services using various libraries and modules. Some of the commonly used methods are:

HTTP Requests: Python can make HTTP requests to interact with web servers. The requests library is the most commonly used for this purpose. It allows you to send HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and handle responses easily.

Example:

python
Copy code
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
Web Scraping: Python can extract data from web pages using libraries like BeautifulSoup or Scrapy. These libraries parse HTML and XML documents and provide methods for extracting data from them.

Example:

python
Copy code
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

response = requests.get('https://example.com')
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
Socket Programming: Python's socket module allows low-level networking operations. It can be used to create sockets and establish connections with servers, enabling custom network communication.

Example:

python
Copy code
import socket
s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
s.connect(('example.com', 80))
Database Access: Python has database interfaces for various database systems like SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. Libraries like sqlite3, mysql-connector-python, psycopg2, etc., allow Python programs to connect to and interact with databases.

Example (using SQLite):

python
Copy code
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
API Interaction: Python can interact with APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) to exchange data with external services. Libraries like requests are often used to make HTTP requests to RESTful APIs, while some services offer Python SDKs for easier integration.

Example:

python
Copy code
import requests
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/data')
Message Queues: Python can communicate with message queues like RabbitMQ, Kafka, etc., using client libraries for these systems. This allows for asynchronous communication and distributed processing.

Example:

python
Copy code
from kafka import KafkaProducer
producer = KafkaProducer(bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092')
These are just a few examples of how Python can communicate with external sources. Depending on the specific requirements and the type of interaction needed, you can choose the appropriate method or library.

Create a file transfer application that allows users to send files over a network using socket connections.
Database Access:

Develop a personal finance manager that stores transaction data in a SQLite database and provides analytics and visualization of spending habits.
Build a blogging platform using Django or Flask where users can create, edit, and delete blog posts stored in a MySQL or PostgreSQL database.
API Interaction:

Create a Twitter bot that automatically tweets updates or responds to mentions using the Twitter API.
Develop a weather application that retrieves weather forecasts from a weather API and presents them to users in a user-friendly format.
Message Queues:

Build a task queue system using Celery and RabbitMQ to distribute and process tasks asynchronously.
Develop a real-time analytics dashboard that processes incoming data streams using Apache Kafka and displays insights in real-time.
These projects will not only showcase your proficiency in Python but also demonstrate your ability to interact with external sources and handle various types of data. Additionally, they can be tailored to match your interests and the specific requirements of the positions you're applying for.
